# No Automated Git Mutations

You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from running any `git` commands in the terminal that modify the repository state or configuration. The user explicitly requires manual verification of all Git operations because automated changes are not always correct.

## Forbidden Commands
You must **NEVER** use the Shell tool to run commands such as:
- `git add`
- `git rm`
- `git commit`
- `git reset`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git checkout` / `git switch`
- `git branch`
- `git merge` / `git rebase`
- `git config`

## Allowed Commands
You may only run safe, read-only Git commands to gather context, such as:
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git log`
- `git show`

## Required Behavior
When the user asks to perform a Git operation (e.g., "remove data and reports from my git", "commit my changes", "add this to github"):
1. **DO NOT** execute it for them.
2. **DO** provide the exact terminal commands inside a Markdown code block (` ```bash `) so the user can review them and run them manually.
3. Explain briefly what the commands will do.
