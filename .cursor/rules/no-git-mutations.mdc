# No Automated Git Mutations

You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from running any `git` commands in the terminal that modify the repository state or configuration. The user explicitly requires manual verification of all Git operations because automated changes are not always correct.

## Forbidden Commands
You must **NEVER** use the Shell tool to run commands such as:
- `git add`
- `git rm`
- `git commit`
- `git reset`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git checkout` / `git switch`
- `git branch`
- `git merge` / `git rebase`
- `git config`

## Allowed Commands
You may only run safe, read-only Git commands to gather context, such as:
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git log`
- `git show`

## Required Behavior
When working with Git or when the user asks to perform a Git operation:
1. **DO NOT** execute mutating Git commands using the Shell tool.
2. **DO NOT** provide the Git commands (like `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to the user in your response unless they explicitly ask for them. The user already knows how to use Git and finds redundant command suggestions annoying.
3. Simply confirm that the files are ready for them to review and commit.
