# No Auto-Commits

- **NEVER** run `git commit` automatically without the user's explicit permission.
- The user requires manual checking of all code changes before they are committed to version control.
- If a task involves git operations, prepare the files or simply provide the user with the git commands to run, so they can review the staged changes and perform the commit themselves.
